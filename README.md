### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challenge mainly hiding HTML elements by showing and hiding CSS classes.
Although, there are many ways to do it, with HTML templates and fragments for example, or directly creating the elements with JS. But, since I know more CSS and I'm just learning JS, I did it that way, more secure for me. But, I'll try injecting fragments into the HTML.
